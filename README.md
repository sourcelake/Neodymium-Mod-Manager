Neodymium (Neo for short) uses python `requests` to download minecraft mods* straight to your minecraft folder.
As of 28/06/24, only source code is avaliable.

# How to use:
1. if you haven't yet, download python.
2. For linux distributions, use `sudo apt install python3-pip` if it isn't already installed.
3. Download py-curses, for windows: `pip install windows-curses`. For linux distributions run: `sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev`\
4. run using: `python3 Neo.py`

*just configurable enough that you could probably use it with other curseforge games.
